# ENDOTRAIN Wearable Features Demo

Minimal, reproducible demo pipeline for extracting circadian and variability features from wearable-style time-series data (sleep/activity proxies and basic heart-rate proxies).

## Why this repo
Created while preparing applications to doctoral positions at the interface of endocrinology, chronobiology, and digital health (wearables/biosensors).

## Contents
- `notebooks/01_feature_extraction_demo.ipynb`: load → QC → features → plots → summary table
- `data/sample_data.csv`: synthetic example data (no patient data)

## Planned extensions
- missingness sensitivity analysis (7 vs 14 days)
- simple baseline model for longitudinal outcomes
